### Elevator pitch

Daily games have become a staple of millions of people's daily routine for years now, whether it is Wordle, the NYT mini crossword, or Connections, I would bet that you have played one of them before. Well now it's time to add another game to your daily routine, Diverdle! This is a daily game based off of the recent smash hit videogame Helldivers II. Players will try to guess what the weapon of the day is, while each guess reveals attributes that are shared between the weapon of the day and the current guessed weapon. Although it will be challenging, it will be a great addition to your daily routine!
